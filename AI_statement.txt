For this lab assignment I used generative AI (github Copilot) as an assistant when writing code.
It helped me autofill the obvious parameters to a functioncall and other brainless typing. 
In addition to autofill, I used AI as a tool for debugging, and testing different ways to implement logic.
As an example, I had issues with floating point arthmetic, as I could not find the compiler flag for enabling floating point operatins within
the CPUlator, I needed a way to work around floating point operations. As a result, every trigometric 
function has been rewritten to integer operations with a SCALE_FACTOR. The initial idea for this solution 
was generated by github copilot, but I have spent far too many hours implementing the solution.
